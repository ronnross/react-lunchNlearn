# React Lunch n learn

All resources used during talk

The slides were make using an open source React project called [Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle).

You can also find the code from the [refactoring demo here](/react-lunchNlearn-example).

The two projects that rendered React from the server.
1. [Nodejs example](https://github.com/bananaoomarang/isomorphic-redux)
1. [Java example](https://github.com/harithakram/nashorn-example )

My Flux library recommendation [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux), and here is a nice [React Redux starter project](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit)

Good luck everyone
